A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end.
Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information.
A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point.
It might describe a place, character, or process.
Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics.
One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.
A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence.
A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay’s thesis statement.
Readers generally look to the first few sentences.
That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph.
In some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another sentence before the topic sentence.
Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence.
You might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of events.
The vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.
